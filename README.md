# hello-world
Hello World repository for Git learning.
This is an example of git repository.
This repository is built step by step in vscode using the guidelines from w3schools.

And now I am editing the readme page from github.
This is fast but I do not know for sure how much have I actually learned from the entire exercise on an internet website.
